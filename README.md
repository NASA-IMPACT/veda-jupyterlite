JupyterLite deployed as a static site to GitHub Pages, for demo purposes.

This repository is based off of [jupyterlite-demo](https://github.com/jupyterlite/demo). In addition to standard demo
notebooks it includes github links to some interactive visualizations written for voici. You can check
out the standalone versions of those visualizations at:
